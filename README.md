# Mesan Digital News App

A News App with Search functionality for iOS and Android devices using https://newsapi.org/ API as data source. 

The app consists of a Dashboard and Search screen. Articles on the dashboard are grouped by categories in a panel with the option to view more articles for that specific category. 

Articles in a panel can displayed in either a vertical or horizontal direction. Each article will have an image, title, source and published date. The position of the image can either be at the top, left or right.
